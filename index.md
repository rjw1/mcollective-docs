The Marionette Collective aka. mcollective is a framework to build server orchestration 
or parallel job execution systems.

Mcollective's primary use is to programmatically execute actions on clusters of servers. 
In this regard it operates in the same space as tools like Func, Fabric or Capistrano.

By not relying on central inventories and tools like SSH, it's not simply a fancy SSH 
"for loop". MCollective uses modern tools like Publish Subscribe Middleware and modern 
philosophies like real time discovery of network resources using meta data and not 
hostnames. Delivering a very scalable and very fast parallel execution 
environment.

The focus is on catering to the needs of enterprises and large deploys.  Pluggable Authentication, 
Authorization and Auditing capabilities sets it apart from other tools in this space.

introduction about what you can do with mcollective and some of our goals and approaches.
