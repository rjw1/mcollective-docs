Writing Agents
--------------

Simple RPC works because it makes a lot of assumptions about how you write agents, we'll try to capture those assumptions here and show you how to apply them to our Helloworld agent.

We've recorded a [tutorial that will give you a quick look at what is involved in writing agents][WritingAgentsScreenCast].

### Conventions regarding Incoming Data

As you've seen in [SimpleRPCClients] our clients will send requests like:

{% highlight ruby %}
mc.echo(:msg => "Welcome to MCollective Simple RPC")
{% endhighlight %}

A more complex example might be:

{% highlight ruby %}
exim.setsender(:msgid => "1NOTVx-00028U-7G", :sender => "foo@bar.com")
{% endhighlight %}

Effectively this creates a hash with the members _:msgid_ and _:sender_, you could use strings for the data items too:

{% highlight ruby %}
exim.setsender("msgid" => "1NOTVx-00028U-7G", "senderid" => "foo@bar.com")
{% endhighlight %}

Your data types should be preserved if your Security plugin supports that - the default one does - so you can pass in Arrays, Hashes, OpenStructs, Hashes of Hashes but you should always pass something in and it should be key/value pairs like a Hash expects.

From version *0.4.5* onward you cannot use the a data item called _:process_results_ as this has special meaning to the agent and client.  This will indicate to the agent that the client is'nt going to be waiting to process results.  You might choose not to send back a reply based on this.

### Sample Agent
Here's our sample *Helloworld* agent:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
module MCollective
    module Agent
        class Helloworld<RPC::Agent
            # Basic echo server
            action "echo" do
                validate :msg, String
     
                reply.data = request[:msg]
            end
        end
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Strictly speaking this Agent will work but isn't considered complete - there's no meta data and no help.

#### Agent Name
The agent name is derived from the class name, the example code creates *MCollective::Agent::Helloworld* and the agent name would be *helloworld*.

<a name="Meta_Data_and_Initialization">&nbsp;</a>
#### Meta Data and Initialization
Simple RPC agents still need meta data like in [WritingAgents], without it you'll just have some defaults assigned, code below adds the meta data to our agent:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
module MCollective
    module Agent
        class Helloworld<RPC::Agent
            metadata :name        => "SimpleRPC Sample Agent",
                     :description => "Echo service for MCollective", 
                     :author      => "R.I.Pienaar",
                     :license     => "GPLv2",
                     :version     => "1.1",
                     :url         => "http://mcollective-plugins.googlecode.com/",
                     :timeout     => 60

            # Basic echo server
            action "echo" do
                validate :msg, String
     
                reply.data = request[:msg]
            end
        end
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The added code sets our creator info, license and version as well as a timeout.  The timeout is how long MCollective will let your agent run for before killing them, this is a very important number and should be given careful consideration.  If you set it too low your agents will be terminated before their work is done.

The default timeout for SimpleRPC agents is *10*.

#### Writing Actions
Actions are the individual tasks that your agent can do, they should just be in methods matching the _name`_`action_.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
            def echo_action
                validate :msg, String
     
                reply.data = request[:msg]
            end
{% endhighlight %}

There's a helper to create this for you, you saw it earlier:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
            action "echo" do
                validate :msg, String
     
                reply.data = request[:msg]
            end
{% endhighlight %}

These two code blocks have the identical outcome, the 2nd usage is recommended.

Creates an action called "echo".  They don't and can't take any arguments.

### Help and the Data Description Language
We have a separate file that goes together with an agent and is used to describe the agent in detail, a DDL file for the above echo agent can be seen below:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
metadata :name        => "SimpleRPC Sample Agent",
         :description => "Echo service for MCollective", 
         :author      => "R.I.Pienaar",
         :license     => "GPLv2",
         :version     => "1.1",
         :url         => "http://mcollective-plugins.googlecode.com/",
         :timeout     => 60

action "echo", description "Echos back any message it receives" do
   input :msg,
         :prompt      => "Service Name",
         :description => "The service to get the status for",
         :type        => :string,
         :validation  => '^[a-zA-Z\-_\d]+$',
         :optional    => false,
         :maxlength   => 30

   output :data,
          :description => "The message we received",
          :display_as  => "Message"
end
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the DDL file expand on the basic syntax adding a lot of markup, help and other important validation data.  This information - when available - helps in making more robust clients and also potentially auto generating user interfaces.

The DDL is a complex topic, read all about it in [SimpleRPCDDL].

### Validating Input
If you've followed the conventions and put the incoming data in a Hash structure then you can use a few of the provided validators to make sure your data that you received is what you expected.

If you didn't use Hashes for input the validators would not be usable to you.  In future validation will happen automatically based on the [SimpleRPCDDL] so I strongly suggest you follow the agent design pattern shown here using hashes.

In the sample action above we validate the *:msg* input to be of type *String*, here are a few more examples:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
   validate :msg, /[a-zA-Z]+/
   validate :ipaddr, :ipv4address
   validate :ipaddr, :ipv6address
   validate :commmand, :shellsafe
{% endhighlight %}

The table below shows the validators we support currently

<tr><th><b>Type of Check</b></th><th><b>Description</b></th><th><b>Example</b></th></tr>
<tr><td>Regular Expressions</td><td>Matches the input against the supplied regular expression</td><td>validate :msg, /[a-zA-Z]+/</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type Checks</td><td>Verifies that input is of a given ruby data type</td><td>validate :msg, String</td></tr>
<tr><td>IPv4 Checks</td><td>Validates an ip v4 address, note 5.5.5.5 is technically a valid address</td><td>validate :ipaddr, :ipv4address</td></tr>
<tr><td>IPv6 Checks</td><td>Validates an ip v6 address</td><td>validate :ipaddr, :ipv6address</td></tr>
<tr><td>system call safety checks</td><td>Makes sure the input is a string and has no &gt;&lt;` or | characters in it</td><td>validate :command, :shellsafe</td></tr>

All of these checks will raise an InvalidRPCData exception, you shouldn't catch this exception as the Simple RPC framework catches those and handles them appropriately.

We'll make input validators plugins so you can provide your own types of validation easily.

### Agent Configuration

You can save configuration for your agents in the main server config file:

{% highlight ini %}
 plugin.helloworld.setting = foo
{% endhighlight %}

In your code you can retrieve the config setting like this:

{% highlight ini %}
 setting = config.pluginconf["helloworld.setting"] || ""
{% endhighlight %}

This will set the setting to whatever is the config file of "" if unset.

### Accessing the Input
As you see from the echo example our input is easy to get to by just looking in *request.data*, this would be a Hash of exactly what was sent in by the client in the original request.

The request object is in instance of *MCollective::RPC::Request*, you can also gain access to the following:

<table>
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>time</td><td>The time the message was sent</td></tr>
<tr><td>action</td><td>The action it is directed at</td></tr>
<tr><td>data</td><td>The actual hash of data</td></tr>
<tr><td>sender</td><td>The id of the sender</td></tr>
<tr><td>agent</td><td>Which agent it was directed at</td></tr>
</table>

Since data is the actual Hash you can gain access to your input like:

{% highlight ruby %}
 request.data[:msg]
{% endhighlight %}

OR

{% highlight ruby %}
request[:msg]
{% endhighlight %}

Accessing it via the first will give you full access to all the normal Hash methods where the 2nd will only give you access to *include?*.

### Constructing Replies
#### Reply Data
The reply data is in the *reply* variable and is an instance of *MCollective::RPC::Reply*.  

You can pass values back by simply assining anything to the data like here:

{% highlight ruby %}
reply.data = request[:msg]
{% endhighlight %}

In this example data will be a String, nothing fancy gets done to it if you assign directly to _reply.data_

Or there's a few convenience methods if you wanted to pass back a hash of data.

{% highlight ruby %}
reply[:msg] = request[:msg]
{% endhighlight %}

Here reply will act as if it's a hash so you don't have to do *reply.data`[`:msg`]`* all the time.

#### Reply Status
As pointed out in the [ResultsandExceptions] page results all include status messages and the reply object has a helper to create those.

{% highlight ruby %}
def rmmsg_action
   validate :msg, String
   validate :msg, /[a-zA-Z]+-[a-zA-Z]+-[a-zA-Z]+-[a-zA-Z]+/
   reply.fail "No such message #{request[:msg]}", 1 unless have_msg?(request[:msg])

   # check all the validation passed before doing any work
   return unless reply.statuscode == 0

   # now remove the message from the queue
end
{% endhighlight %}

The number in *reply.fail* corresponds to the codes in [ResultsandExceptions] it would default to *1* so you could just say:

{% highlight ruby %}
reply.fail "No such message #{request[:msg]}" unless have_msg?(request[:msg])
{% endhighlight %}

This is hypothetical action that is supposed to remove a message from some queue, if we do have a String as input that matches our message id's we then check that we do have such a message and if we don't we fail with a helpful message.

Technically this will just set *statuscode* and *statusmsg* fields in the reply to appropriate values.

It won't actually raise exceptions or exit your action though you should do that yourself as in the example here.

From version 0.4.3 onward there is also a *fail!* instead of just *fail* it does the same basic function but also raises exceptions.  This lets you abort processing of the agent immediately without performing your own checks on *statuscode* as above later on.

### Authorization
You can write a fine grained Authorization system to control access to actions and agents, please see [SimpleRPCAuthorization] for full details.

### Auditing
The actions that agents perform can be Audited by code you provide, potentially creating a centralized audit log of all actions.  See [SimpleRPCAuditing] for full details.

### Logging
You can write to the server log file using the normal logger class:

{% highlight ruby %}
logger.debug ("Hello from your agent")
{% endhighlight %}

You can log at levels *info*, *warn*, *debug*, *fatal* or *error*.

### Processing Hooks
We provide a few hooks into the processing of a message, you've already used this earlier to <a href="#Meta_Data_and_Initialization">set meta data</a>.

You'd use these hooks to add some functionality into the processing chain of agents, maybe you want to add extra logging for audit purposes of the raw incoming message and replies, these hooks will let you do that.

<table>
<tr><th>Hook Function Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>startup_hook</td><td>Called at the end of the initialize method of the _RPC::Agent_ base class</td></tr>
<tr><td>before_processing_hook(msg, connection)</td><td>Before processing of a message starts, pass in the raw message and the <em>MCollective::Connector</em> class</td></tr>
<tr><td>after_processing_hook</td><td>Just before the message is dispatched to the client</td></tr>
</table>

#### startup`_`hook
Called at the end of the _RPC::Agent_ standard initialize method use this to adjust meta parameters, timeouts and any setup you need to do.

This will not be called right when the daemon starts up, we use lazy loading and initialization so it will only be called the first time a request for this agent arrives.

#### before`_`processing`_`hook
Called just after a message was received from the middleware before it gets passed to the handlers.  *request* and *reply* will already be set, the msg passed is the message as received from the normal mcollective runner and the connection is the actual connector.

You can in theory send off new messages over the connector maybe for auditing or something, probably limited use case in simple agents.

#### after`_`processing`_`hook
Called at the end of processing just before the response gets sent to the middleware.

This gets run outside of the main exception handling block of the agent so you should handle any exceptions you could raise yourself.  The reason  it is outside of the block is so you'll have access to even status codes set by the exception handlers.  If you do raise an exception it will just be passed onto the runner and processing will fail.
